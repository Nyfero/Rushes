# Hotrace

Description: 
Making a search engine like Google or Safari, is not so complicated in the end. The steps are simple: get a lof of data, then just perform search using keywords. All the difficulty lies in returning the responses quickly. There is fierce competition in the search industry between Google, Yahoo, Bing and a whole bunch of other search engines that hardly existed. It's a race where everyone is on the hot seat.

This project was made from 2021-12-10 to 2021-12-12 with Geoffrey Argence.
